## Python Learning Path

![Certificate]("[Py_CertMimo.pdf](https://github.com/TevThom8/Mimo/blob/main/Py_CertMimo.pdf)")

This repository contains my completed exercises and projects from the Python learning path on Mimo. Through this learning path, I gained foundational knowledge and practical skills in Python programming.

Topics Covered

	•	Basic Syntax: Learned about variables, data types, operators, and basic syntax rules in Python.
	•	Control Flow: Understood concepts such as if statements, loops, and conditional expressions to control the flow of the program.
	•	Functions: Explored the creation and usage of functions to encapsulate reusable blocks of code.
	•	Data Structures: Learned about lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, and their manipulation in Python.
	•	File Handling: Explored reading from and writing to files in Python.
	•	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Understood the principles of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
